# virtual interface programming language
##  It is a language just like ruby

```ruby
    
   data ="hellow world";
   def main
      System.println(data);
      data=32 * 21 - 221;
      if data equals true { 
      System.println("result is "+data1);
      }
    end

```
it is the next version after making vip compiled one.
currently it is non functional
